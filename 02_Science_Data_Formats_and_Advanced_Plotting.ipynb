    "\n",
    "NetCDF and HDF are self-describing formats, which are structured binary data files and useful for storing other big datasets. Computationally, it is faster to read in binary-based datasets than text, which needs to be parsed before being stored in a computerâ€™s memory. Because the files are more compact, they are cheaper to store large, long-term satellite data. Furthermore, information about the data (\"metadata\") can be stored inside the file themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many environmental dataset names are quite long. However, the dataset name is encoded to give us information about the contents. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "JRR-AOD_v2r3_j01_s202304220518119_e202304220519346_c202304220600390.nc\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can learn several important features of the dataset without opening it:\n",

    "* Prefix indicates the mission (JRR, for JPSS Risk Reduction)\n",

In the ```ax.scatter``` line, you use the transform keyword argument in scatter to define the from coordinates (Plate CarrÃ©e), which are the coordinates that the data formatted for.\n",
